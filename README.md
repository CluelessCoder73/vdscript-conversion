# vdscript-conversion
Some python scripts for converting the "VirtualDub" vdscript format into other formats.
Features of these scripts:
# Convert vdscript to a text file with a nice "human readable" layout of the cutlist
# Adjust vdscript cutpoints to be "legal", so to speak (while ensuring that NO frames are lost in the process!). This is particularly useful when working with proxy videos
# Convert vdscript to an "AviSynth" cutlist
# Convert vdscript to a "Cuttermaran" project file
# Convert vdscript to a "LosslessCut" project file
# Convert "VirtualDub2" vdscript to "VirtualDub" vdscript

Note: All the python scripts (with the exception of "vdub_generate_1000-cuts_VidDirect.py" & "VDub2toVDub_VidDirect_Conversion.py") work with both "VirtualDub" & "VirtualDub2" vdscript files!
